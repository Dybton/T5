- You can locate the functions for extracting fixed effects and the count_query_components function in the data-exploration.ipynb file. 
- For the generate_graphql_query function, please refer to the synthetic data file.

- For further testing and result verification, particularly with the semantic match function called 'are_queries_semantically_equivalent', I utilize the jupyter equivalent, T5_SP2.ipynb.
